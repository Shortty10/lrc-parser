[00:18.95]Hey, brother, what you thinking?
[00:20.94]Leave that old record spinning
[00:22.92]You feel the rhythm, going
[00:24.96](They call it lonely digging)
[00:26.92]Let's end your time to lay low
[00:28.68]Your knees a-bending, so
[00:30.68]It's time to get up and let go
[00:32.71](You're gonna come undone)
[00:34.66]Hey, mama, how's it going?
[00:36.66]Can't see your body moving
[00:38.66]Don't leave the party dying
[00:40.41](They call it lonely digging)
[00:42.40]Your booty shaking, you know
[00:44.42]Your head has no right to say no
[00:46.15]Tonight it's ready, set, go
[00:49.47]Baby can you move it round the rhythm
[00:50.98]So we can get with 'em
[00:51.72]To the ground and get us a rock and roll round
[00:53.98]Just a downtown body body coming with a super-hottie
[00:55.97]Let's go, yes, no, hell no
[00:57.48]Baby can you move it round the rhythm
[00:58.70]'Cause you know we're living in the fast lane, speed up
[01:00.90]It ain't no game, just turn up all the beams when I come up on the scene
[01:05.34]Hey, brother, what you thinking?
[01:07.37]That good ol' sound is ringing
[01:09.38]They don't know what they're missing
[01:11.38](They call it lonely digging)
[01:13.39]Let's end your time to lay low
[01:15.38]Your knees a-bending, so
[01:17.38]It's time to get up and let go
[01:21.13]Hey, brother, nice and steady
[01:22.89]Put down your drink, you ready
[01:24.89]It's hard when things get messy
[01:27.14](They call it lonely digging)
[01:28.89]Your booty shaking, you know
[01:30.88]Your head has no right to say no
[01:32.63]Tonight it's ready, set, go
[01:36.13]Baby can you move it round the rhythm
[01:37.13]So we can get with 'em
[01:38.38]To the ground and get us a rock and roll round

[02:24.38]To the ground and get us a rock and roll round
[02:26.63]Just a downtown body body coming with a super-hottie
[02:28.67]Let's go, yes, no, hell no
[02:30.09]Baby can you move it round the rhythm
[02:31.38]'Cause you know we're living in the fast lane, speed up
